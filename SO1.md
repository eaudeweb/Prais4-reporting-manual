# 1. Strategic objective 1

To improve the condition of affected ecosystems, combat desertification/ land degradation, promote sustainable land management and contribute to land degradation neutrality

## 1.1. SO 1-1 – Trends in land cover

### 1.1.1. Introduction
Land cover refers to the observed (bio)physical cover on the Earth’s surface. 

The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) methodology for estimating the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (i.e. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1) uses land cover change as an indicator of altered ecosystem dynamics resulting from natural and/or artificial drivers and factors. 

The main output of the reporting process for indicator SO1-1 is a set of officially verified estimates of the extent of land cover classes, their changes at national level and their significance in terms of land degradation.

National reporting is facilitated though the provision of: (i) default data derived from available global data sources, namely the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI-LC) products; and (ii) guidance on how to interpret transitions across land cover classes as processes that are likely to reduce the biological or economic productivity and complexity of the land (degradation), improve it, or result in no change (stable).

### 1.1.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- An in-depth reading of chapter 3 of the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1: Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (version 2), which provides an overview of the land cover indicator, its definition and classifications, and the recommended methodology to assess land cover degradation;

- Data complying with the minimum standards listed in table 10 below;

- A pool of national experts officially nominated by the national authorities to verify the reliability of the identified land cover changes and their links with the main land degradation processes. This may involve ground-truthing surveys and/or organizing interviews with local communities and key informants. Key institutions might include a country’s national statistical office, ministry of environment, ministry of agriculture, ministry of water resources, meteorological department, remote-sensing centre, food security and nutrition department, as well as universities and research centres.

### 1.1.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The step-by-step procedure for reporting is described in the following. If Parties decide to use the default data, steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 are unnecessary. 

<I>Step 1: Report on land area</I>
<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=BLACK>

      <td><I>Related areas in the PRAIS 4 platform: table SO1-1.T1</I></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Information on the total land area, area covered by water bodies, and total country area is required to calculate the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (SDG indicator 15.3.1), but also to calculate indicators to track progress towards other SOs (e.g. SO 3-1: Trends in the proportion of land under drought over the total land area). This information is also useful to investigate possible climate impacts, which could potentially be identified by the reduction in size or disappearance of permanent water bodies and the loss of coastline.

Total land area, total water bodies area and total country area require respective estimates to be reported in square kilometres (km2) every five years from 2000 to 2015, and then for the most recent reported year. Land area data is pre-filled in the reporting table SO1-1.T1. Estimates are based on the default land cover data and, as such, they could differ from official national statistics. The pre-filled data is editable and thus can be adjusted. However, it is important to ensure consistency with the land cover data and the SDG indicator 15.3.1 estimates. Any changes are to be justified in the ‘Comments’ column.

<I>Step 2: Identify key degradation processes</I>

Parties are invited to list the most relevant land cover change processes that are likely to result in a depletion of land resources. Key processes might include deforestation, urban expansion or vegetation loss. Some of these processes may be detectable through the image analysis of land cover change, while others may only be evident with field observations. Table 7 shows examples of processes likely to cause land degradation and which are listed as options in the drop-down menu in table SO1-1.T2 of the PRAIS 4 platform. Other processes not covered in the menu can be reported on by selecting the ‘Other’ option.

Land cover information should be classified using either the default UNCCD legend comprising seven broad land cover classes for aggregate reporting, or a national land cover legend that allows key country-specific degradation processes to be monitored and which can be harmonized with the seven UNCCD land cover classes.

The default UNCCD land cover legend includes the following seven classes: tree-covered areas, grassland, cropland, wetland, artificial surfaces, other land, and water bodies.  
It is important to highlight that the objective of SO 1-1 reporting is to capture and document past and ongoing key land cover changes causing land degradation, not to report a fully comprehensive national land cover legend which lists all possible land cover classes occurring within a country. Accordingly, national land cover legends should be customized to only include the minimum number of classes needed to capture and monitor land degradation processes reported on in Step 2.

If a country opts to use a national land cover legend, they should fill in table SO1-1.T3 with national land cover classes showing how they map to the default seven UNCCD land cover classes. Countries are strongly encouraged to build the legend with a limited number of relevant classes. This will make reporting more manageable and would reduce the transitions to be described and reported in Step 4. With reference to the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1, the legend should be:

- *Competent*, for capturing the degradation transitions identified as significant;

- *Usable*, such that available observational data can distinguish between the classes in the legend; and

- *Exhaustive*, such that the entire land area of the country can be attributed to classes from the legend and monitored through time.

Wherever possible, UNCCD encourages Parties to use the Land Cover Meta Language (LCML) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which provides a structured approach to land cover definition and interpretation. The LCML is the conceptual and structural backbone of various land cover classifications, including the land cover legend used by the ESA CCI-LC products. 

Table 8 shows the conversion between the default UNCCD legend and the ESA CCI-LC legend.

_Step 4: Generate a transition matrix_

Land degradation is context-specific and tightly dependent on the characteristics of the environment. Land degradation processes are not independent, and mitigating one may lead to an increase in another form of degradation. By defining a transition matrix, Parties must decide which land cover changes and processes are expected to cause land degradation, improvement or no change.

Table 9 presents an example of a transition matrix for the default UNCCD land cover classes. The matrix shows suggested interpretations of changes in land cover that may result in land degradation or improvement. Parties might use this matrix as a preliminary framework to be evaluated and adjusted through a multi-stakeholder participatory process and in consideration of the national and local conditions.

For completeness, water bodies are also included in the matrix, although the focus of reporting is on total land area for the purpose of calculating SDG indicator 15.3.1. All water body-related transitions are set as ‘stable’ by default, but Parties may alter these values if changes in the extent of water bodies during the baseline or the reporting period had a significant impact on land cover. It should be noted that any change in the extent of inland water bodies affects the total land area, which needs to be adjusted accordingly.

<I>Note: Land cover change processes are color coded as improvement (green), stable (yellow) or degradation (red). Unlikely transitions are written in red. Note that this is an example of a transition matrix and should not be interpreted as appropriate for countries to adopt without consideration of local conditions and key degradation processes.</I>
</p>
Depending on the land cover legend selected in Step 3, Parties will need to provide their interpretation of land cover transitions using tables SO1-1.T4a or SO1-1.T4b for (i) UNCCD default land cover classes; (ii) or national land cover classes, respectively.

The PRAIS 4 platform includes functions to modify the default transition matrix data and assign a ‘–’ or ‘+’ sign to each transition depending on whether it causes a degradation or improvement of the land according to national circumstances. However, if opting to modify the default transition matrix (i.e. table SO1-1.T4a), the transition matrix should first be edited in Trends.Earth so that the reported transitions can be integrated into the calculations of the SO 1-1 outputs and SDG indicator 15.3.1. Editing the transition matrix in PRAIS 4 alone will not result in a recalculation of the spatial data for SO 1-1.

_Step 5: Assess available data_

UNCCD provides prefilled default data in the PRAIS 4 platform derived from the latest ESA CCI-LC dataset to lighten the reporting burden. However, Parties may report their estimates using national land cover data if they meet the specifications listed in table 10.

</p>

_Step 6: Determine the baseline extent of land cover degradation_

<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=BLACK>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><I>Related areas in the PRAIS 4 platform: tables SO1-1.T5, SO1-1.T6 and SO1-1.T8</I></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The baseline sets the benchmark against which change in the extent of land cover degradation is compared in subsequent reporting periods. Determining the baseline extent consists of comparing the land cover in the final year of the baseline period (the baseline year, i.e. 2015) with that of the initial year (2000) to estimate what changed (in terms of land cover transitions), calculate the net area change per land cover class and infer the land degradation status based on the transition matrix. Using a consistent baseline is extremely important since it affects the results of change calculations between the baseline and the reporting periods. These changes are used to monitor Parties’ progress on SO 1-1. 

Default national estimates of land cover change and land cover degradation for the baseline period are made available in tables SO1-1.T6 and SO1-1.T8 of PRAIS 4, respectively. These estimates can be accepted, adjusted or replaced using national data, as appropriate. Supporting comments should be entered into in the comments box provided to justify the modification or replacement of default data. Countries opting to use national data are encouraged to use Trends.Earth for the preparation, analysis and transfer of their data to PRAIS 4. Trends.Earth includes tools to automatically estimate land cover changes and land cover degradation. 

_Step 7: Estimate land cover degradation_

<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=BLACK>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><I>Related areas in the PRAIS 4 platform: tables SO1-1.T1, SO1-1.T5, SO1-1.T7 and SO1-1.T9</I></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Default national estimates of land cover change and land cover degradation for the reporting period are made available in tables SO1-1.T5 and SO1-1.T7, respectively. These estimates are calculated by comparing the land cover in the most recent available year of the reporting period (i.e. 2019 for the default data) with that of the initial year of the reporting period (2016). These estimates can be accepted, adjusted or replaced using national data, as appropriate.   

Using the selected data, legend and transition matrix, Parties may produce national estimates of (i) land cover change; (ii) land cover degradation; (iii) land cover improvement; and (iv) no change for the reporting period through Trends.Earth and import the results to the PRAIS 4 platform, where the relevant maps can be created.

_Step 8: Verify the results_

The remote-sensing interpretation of land cover changes varies greatly across the globe, strongly influenced by the prevailing climatic conditions and land management practices. This may affect the reliability of applying estimates from global data sources to local areas and require inputs from national experts to identify and highlight situations where the confidence level of the obtained results might be low. This input would contribute to a qualitative assessment of the reliability of the estimates. 

_Step 9: Generate reports_

The PRAIS 4 platform enables the reporting of quantitative information on land cover, land cover changes and land cover degradation. In the absence of more accurate and detailed data at the national level, Parties may officially submit to UNCCD the default estimates. For estimates generated using national data, Parties should provide:

- A description of the legend and transition matrix;

- National land cover datasets for the baseline and the reporting period;

- Land cover change information, including a land cover area change matrix and a spatial dataset that shows the areas subject to degradation, improvement or no change based on land cover data.

Information on land cover, land cover changes and land cover degradation should be reported in km2 for the entire country. Reporting on affected areas only should be done via a separate set of forms on the PRAIS 4 platform. 

If the default datasets have been replaced with national land cover data, countries are encouraged to upload the relevant geospatial data to PRAIS. Any spatial data uploaded to the system must be supported by appropriate metadata describing the spatial data, as indicated in the metadata upload form.

Default maps or maps generated in Trends.Earth using national data representing land cover, land cover change and land cover degradation for the baseline/reporting period are made available in the PRAIS 4 platform. More specifically, the following maps will be available online:

- Land cover map of the initial year of the baseline period (2000) 

- Land cover map of the final year of the baseline period year (2015)

- Land cover map of the latest reporting year

- Land cover change in the baseline period	 

- Land cover change in the reporting period

- Land cover degradation in the baseline period 

- Land cover degradation in the reporting period.

Parties are also invited to submit narratives on methods and process used and to report on special cases and issues using the ‘General Comment’ field.

### 1.1.4. Dependencies

Land cover data is used not only to report on SO 1-1, but also to stratify the indicators on land productivity and soil organic carbon (SOC) (SO 1-2 and SO 1-3) and as one of the sub-indicators to calculate the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (SO 1-4). 

The total land area declared under table SO1-1.T1 drives the calculation of subsequent reporting elements across the SOs, which will be listed as dependent on table SO1-1.T1 in the respective section of the reporting manual.

### 1.1.5. Challenges

_Data availability and quality_
- Spatial resolution of default data might not always be suitable to accurately represent land cover and its changes at national level, especially for small island developing States (SIDS) or mountainous countries, which need the highest spatial resolution data. Complementing/refining international data analysis with local-scale data, if available, can help improve the quality and reliability of the results.

- For analysis and reporting of change in land cover, it is essential to have consistent data (i.e. data derived from the same data source using the same processing technique) over a long period of time; this is often a challenge at both the national and global levels. 

- The validation of national land cover information may need to be cross-checked in the field, also in consultation with local experts. This might be a time consuming and expensive activity to undertake. Validation carried out using different methods and techniques (e.g. samples of field work with existing aerial photography, free high-resolution images available in Google Earth) could considerably reduce costs and resource allocation.

_Land cover classification_
- National land cover legends and transition matrices may be more accurate in capturing local degradation processes and land cover transitions, but might increase the number of possible land cover transitions to be described to an unmanageable amount. While it is important to include the key land cover transitions in a country, a balance between precision and manageability of the information should be considered.

- Existing national land cover maps and data need to be converted to the seven UNCCD classes. The required aggregation of land cover classes to the seven UNCCD classes can partly degrade the quality of the original data. Documenting the uncertainties and generalizations applied to harmonize data with international standards may inform the conversion process and the accuracy of the outputs.

- Land cover information provided to UNCCD should be consistent over time; changes in the land cover classification methodology require recalculations of previously submitted national estimates.

### 1.1.6. Summary (main actions)

Key actions for reporting on land cover changes are as follows:

1.	Report on land area: Information on total land area, the area covered by water bodies and total country area is to be reported in table SO1-1.T1.

2.	Identify the key land degradation processes through the appropriate consultative process and insert the results in table SO1-1.T2.

3.	Select a land cover legend, ensuring compatibility with the UNCCD default legend. Insert the legend in table SO1-1.T3 if different from the UNCCD default legend.

4.	Generate a transition matrix. For each land cover transition, indicate whether it is likely to lead to degradation, improvement or stable conditions. Enter this information in table SO1-1.T4a if the UNCCD land cover legend is used; otherwise use table SO1-1.T4b for national legends.

5.	Select data to be used; ensure compliance with the minimum specifications listed in table 10.

6.	Determine the baseline extent of land cover degradation using the selected data, legend and transition matrix for the baseline period 2000–2015. If national land cover data is used, run the calculations in Trends.Earth and enter this information in tables SO1-1.T5, SO1-1.T6 and SO1-1.T8. 

7.	Estimate land cover degradation using the selected data, legend and transition matrix for the reporting period and based on an assessment of change from the baseline. If national land cover data is used, run the calculations in Trends.Earth and enter this information in tables SO1-1.T5, SO1-1.T7 and SO1-1.T9.

8.	Verify the results: It is recommended that land cover and related land degradation estimates are verified by the concerned national authorities to assess the accuracy of the results and identify any false positive and negative situations which can be reported on in the SO 1-4 forms (SDG indicator 15.3.1). 

9.	Generate reports: Verify the accuracy of the quantitative information entered in the report and include the narrative information on methods and process used.

## 1.2. SO 1-2 – Trends in land productivity

### 1.2.1. Introduction

Land productivity is the biological productive capacity of the land: the principal source of the food, fiber and fuel that sustains humans. 
The UNCCD methodology for estimating the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (i.e. SDG indicator 15.3.1) uses changes in land productivity as an indicator of long-term variations in the health and productive capacity of the land. Land productivity reflects the net effects of changes in ecosystem functioning on plant and biomass growth. 

Land productivity is calculated from Earth observation data representing net primary productivity (NPP). Vegetation indices, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), are often used as proxies for NPP. 

The main output of the reporting process for indicator SO 1-2 is a set of officially verified estimates of the extent of five classes of persistent land productivity trajectories within each land cover type, their changes at national-level and their significance in terms of land degradation.

National reporting is facilitated though the provision of default data derived from available global data sources, namely the Land Productivity Dynamics (LPD) dataset of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission. 

### 1.2.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- An in-depth reading of chapter 4 of the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1 providing an overview on land productivity and detailing the methodology used to estimate land productivity changes;

- Data complying with the specifications listed in table 11 below; 

- A pool of national experts officially nominated by the national authorities to verify the consistency of the land productivity default data against the situation in the field, or to develop and implement a custom methodology to estimate the three land productivity metrics if national data are preferred to the defaults. Key institutions might include a country’s national statistical office, ministry of environment, ministry of agriculture, remote-sensing centre as well as universities and research centres.

### 1.2.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

Estimating land productivity degradation entails:

1)	Producing a land productivity degradation map as a binary representation of degraded/not degraded land in the baseline period;

2)	Mapping land productivity dynamics in the reporting period, indicating areas that have degraded, improved or remained stable compared to the baseline.

The step-by-step procedure for reporting is described in the following. If the default data is used, steps 2 to 6 are unnecessary.

_Step 1: Select Earth observation dataset_

UNCCD provides default data from the LPD dataset of the JRC. The LPD dataset represents five classes of land productivity dynamics from 2000 to 2019. This dataset has a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre, and it is derived from algorithms that combine NDVI time series data from various satellite sensors. 

An alternative global dataset is Trends.Earth Land Productivity, derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data, which integrates NDVI observations at 250 metre (m) pixel resolution over 16-day periods between 18 February 2000 to now. 

Both datasets are available in Trends.Earth.

Parties may evaluate and use these or other datasets, provided they meet the specifications listed in table 11 below.

Parties may also generate their own vegetation index time series directly from the satellite imagery assuming that those images have at least one red and one near infrared band with which to calculate the vegetation index. Depending on the vegetation index chosen, other spectral bands may also be needed.

<I>* Version 2 of the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1 recommends that productivity Trend is assessed over a period of 16 years for both the baseline and reporting periods. This provides a more consistent basis for the assessment of changes in the productivity Trend.</I>

_Step 2:  Select a productivity index_

The NDVI is recommended as the default index for countries to use in the absence of evidence to indicate that an alternative index is better suited to their landscape. Although NDVI is the most widely used and well-known vegetation index, its main limitations are that it can be sensitive to variations in soil background conditions and that it tends to saturate at high vegetation cover and biomass levels. This can reduce the accuracy of NPP, biomass and green cover models in tropical rainforest or arid regions.

Other indices, such as the EVI, may also be suitable. Although some of these indices may perform better than NDVI under some specific vegetation conditions, they may require additional adjustment when applied to vast areas and different land cover types. Consequently, despite its limitations, NDVI is currently considered the universal option for regional- and national-level land productivity calculation, considering that extensive research has demonstrated the strong relationship between NDVI and primary productivity. 

_Step 3: Estimate annual productivity_

The estimation of annual productivity should take into consideration that, due to the natural cycles of growth and senescence of vegetation, NPP is best represented by a time series of observations captured during the full growing season. Therefore, for each pixel location, the annual productivity will be the integral of values from the start to the end of the growing season of the selected productivity index. Areas with increasing NPP should be interpreted as improving, unless assessed otherwise at country level. 

Further indications on options to estimate the start and length of the growing season are given in section 4.2.4.1 of the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1. 

_Step 4: Calculate land productivity metrics_

Estimating changes in productivity over time is based on the multi-temporal analysis of the annual productivity using three metrics:

1.	Trend: measures the trajectory of change in annual productivity over the long term per pixel;

2.	State: compares the current to historical annual productivity per pixel;

3.	Performance: indicates the level of local annual productivity over an area compared with other areas with a similar land productivity potential.

The changes observed in each of the three metrics are combined to determine persistent land productivity trajectories represented in five classes comparable with the default dataset provided by JRC (see table 3 below). They are also used to determine whether a pixel is degraded or not degraded in the baseline period and whether a pixel is degrading, improving or stable in the reporting period (see Step 5). 

_Productivity Trend_

To calculate the productivity Trend, Parties should determine the trajectory of change in productivity over a 16-year time interval on a pixel level. The Trend metric is calculated over an interval of 16 years for both the baseline (2000–2015) and the reporting period (i.e. a 16-year period ending in the last year of data being reported (i.e. 2004–2019).

The Trend metric is calculated by fitting a linear regression model to the time series and determining the significance of the trend slope by calculating its z-score. Positive z-scores indicate a trend of increasing productivity, while negative scores indicate decreasing productivity. Z-scores reflect the magnitude of the slope, with scores of higher magnitude indicating greater strength of the ongoing process.

_Box 1. What is a z-score_

<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=BLACK>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><I>A z-score measures how many standard deviations above or below the mean a data point is. The formula for calculating a z-score is reported below, where ‘z’ is the z-score:

	             data point – mean

	      z = ------------------------

	            standard deviation

Important facts about z-scores:
- A positive z-score indicates that the data point is above average.
- A negative z-score indicates that the data point is below average.
- A z-score close to 0 indicates that the data point is close to average.
- A data point can be considered unusual if its z-score is above or below 3.
</I></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

As recommended in the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1, z-score intervals may be set as follows: 

- z-score < –1.96 = degrading
- z-score < –1.28 AND ≥ –1.96 = potentially degrading
- z-score ≥ –1.28 AND ≤ 1.28 = no significant change
- z-score > 1.28 AND ≤ 1.96 = potentially improving
- z-score > 1.96 = improving

However, for the purposes of UNCCD reporting, the five classes above are simplified into the following three classes:
- z-score < –1.28 = degrading
- z-score < –1.28 AND ≥ –1.28 = stable
- z-score > 1.28 = improving

The pixels with the lowest negative z-score level (< –1.28) are considered degraded and other areas are considered not degraded.

_Productivity State_

Productivity State is determined by comparing the mean annual NPP of the three most recent years to the distribution of annual NPP values observed in the preceding 13 years. More specifically, this entails comparing values for the years 2013–2015 with the years 2000–2012 for the baseline, and the 3 most recent years with the preceding 13 years for the reporting period.

Parties should make the following calculations:

   <tr>
      <th>Baseline</th>
      <th>Reporting period</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>A = Mean annual NPP of the 3 most recent years</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>B = Mean annual NPP 2000–2012</td>
      <td>B = Mean annual NPP of the 13 preceding years</td>

      <td>C = Standard deviation of the 13 preceding years-2023</td>
    </tr>

      <td>z-score = (A – B) / C </td>
      <td>z-score = (A – B) / C -2027</td>
