To improve the condition of affected ecosystems, combat desertification/ land degradation, promote sustainable land management and contribute to land degradation neutrality

## 1.1. SO 1-1 – Trends in land cover

### 1.1.1. Introduction
Land cover refers to the observed (bio)physical cover on the Earth’s surface. 

The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) methodology for estimating the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (i.e. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1) uses land cover change as an indicator of altered ecosystem dynamics resulting from natural and/or artificial drivers and factors. 

The main output of the reporting process for indicator SO1-1 is a set of officially verified estimates of the extent of land cover classes, their changes at national level and their significance in terms of land degradation.

National reporting is facilitated though the provision of: (i) default data derived from available global data sources, namely the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI-LC) products; and (ii) guidance on how to interpret transitions across land cover classes as processes that are likely to reduce the biological or economic productivity and complexity of the land (degradation), improve it, or result in no change (stable).

### 1.1.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- An in-depth reading of chapter 3 of the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1: Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (version 2), which provides an overview of the land cover indicator, its definition and classifications, and the recommended methodology to assess land cover degradation;

- Data complying with the minimum standards listed in table 10 below;

- A pool of national experts officially nominated by the national authorities to verify the reliability of the identified land cover changes and their links with the main land degradation processes. This may involve ground-truthing surveys and/or organizing interviews with local communities and key informants. Key institutions might include a country’s national statistical office, ministry of environment, ministry of agriculture, ministry of water resources, meteorological department, remote-sensing centre, food security and nutrition department, as well as universities and research centres.

### 1.1.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The step-by-step procedure for reporting is described in the following. If Parties decide to use the default data, steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 are unnecessary.
