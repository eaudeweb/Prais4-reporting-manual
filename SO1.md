To improve the condition of affected ecosystems, combat desertification/ land degradation, promote sustainable land management and contribute to land degradation neutrality

## 1.1. SO 1-1 – Trends in land cover

### 1.1.1. Introduction
Land cover refers to the observed (bio)physical cover on the Earth’s surface. 

The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) methodology for estimating the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (i.e. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1) uses land cover change as an indicator of altered ecosystem dynamics resulting from natural and/or artificial drivers and factors. 

The main output of the reporting process for indicator SO1-1 is a set of officially verified estimates of the extent of land cover classes, their changes at national level and their significance in terms of land degradation.

National reporting is facilitated though the provision of: (i) default data derived from available global data sources, namely the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Land Cover (ESA CCI-LC) products; and (ii) guidance on how to interpret transitions across land cover classes as processes that are likely to reduce the biological or economic productivity and complexity of the land (degradation), improve it, or result in no change (stable).

### 1.1.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- An in-depth reading of chapter 3 of the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1: Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (version 2), which provides an overview of the land cover indicator, its definition and classifications, and the recommended methodology to assess land cover degradation;

- Data complying with the minimum standards listed in table 10 below;

- A pool of national experts officially nominated by the national authorities to verify the reliability of the identified land cover changes and their links with the main land degradation processes. This may involve ground-truthing surveys and/or organizing interviews with local communities and key informants. Key institutions might include a country’s national statistical office, ministry of environment, ministry of agriculture, ministry of water resources, meteorological department, remote-sensing centre, food security and nutrition department, as well as universities and research centres.

### 1.1.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The step-by-step procedure for reporting is described in the following. If Parties decide to use the default data, steps 3, 4, 5 and 6 are unnecessary. 

<I>Step 1: Report on land area</I>
<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=BLACK>

  </tbody>

Information on the total land area, area covered by water bodies, and total country area is required to calculate the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area (SDG indicator 15.3.1), but also to calculate indicators to track progress towards other SOs (e.g. SO 3-1: Trends in the proportion of land under drought over the total land area). This information is also useful to investigate possible climate impacts, which could potentially be identified by the reduction in size or disappearance of permanent water bodies and the loss of coastline.

Total land area, total water bodies area and total country area require respective estimates to be reported in square kilometres (km2) every five years from 2000 to 2015, and then for the most recent reported year. Land area data is pre-filled in the reporting table SO1-1.T1. Estimates are based on the default land cover data and, as such, they could differ from official national statistics. The pre-filled data is editable and thus can be adjusted. However, it is important to ensure consistency with the land cover data and the SDG indicator 15.3.1 estimates. Any changes are to be justified in the ‘Comments’ column.

<I>Step 2: Identify key degradation processes</I>

Parties are invited to list the most relevant land cover change processes that are likely to result in a depletion of land resources. Key processes might include deforestation, urban expansion or vegetation loss. Some of these processes may be detectable through the image analysis of land cover change, while others may only be evident with field observations. Table 7 shows examples of processes likely to cause land degradation and which are listed as options in the drop-down menu in table SO1-1.T2 of the PRAIS 4 platform. Other processes not covered in the menu can be reported on by selecting the ‘Other’ option.

Note: These are simplistic examples and attributing a change in state to degradation requires careful assessment at the national level.

<I>Step 3: Select a land cover legend</I>

Land cover information should be classified using either the default UNCCD legend comprising seven broad land cover classes for aggregate reporting, or a national land cover legend that allows key country-specific degradation processes to be monitored and which can be harmonized with the seven UNCCD land cover classes.

The default UNCCD land cover legend includes the following seven classes: tree-covered areas, grassland, cropland, wetland, artificial surfaces, other land, and water bodies.  
It is important to highlight that the objective of SO 1-1 reporting is to capture and document past and ongoing key land cover changes causing land degradation, not to report a fully comprehensive national land cover legend which lists all possible land cover classes occurring within a country. Accordingly, national land cover legends should be customized to only include the minimum number of classes needed to capture and monitor land degradation processes reported on in Step 2.

If a country opts to use a national land cover legend, they should fill in table SO1-1.T3 with national land cover classes showing how they map to the default seven UNCCD land cover classes. Countries are strongly encouraged to build the legend with a limited number of relevant classes. This will make reporting more manageable and would reduce the transitions to be described and reported in Step 4. With reference to the Good Practice Guidance for SDG Indicator 15.3.1, the legend should be:

- *Competent*, for capturing the degradation transitions identified as significant;

- *Usable*, such that available observational data can distinguish between the classes in the legend; and

- *Exhaustive*, such that the entire land area of the country can be attributed to classes from the legend and monitored through time.

Wherever possible, UNCCD encourages Parties to use the Land Cover Meta Language (LCML) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), which provides a structured approach to land cover definition and interpretation. The LCML is the conceptual and structural backbone of various land cover classifications, including the land cover legend used by the ESA CCI-LC products. 

Table 8 shows the conversion between the default UNCCD legend and the ESA CCI-LC legend.
