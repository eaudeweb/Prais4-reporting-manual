SO1-1 Trends in land cover
==========================

Rationale
---------

Land cover refers to the observed physical and biological cover of the Earthâ€™s surface. It describes the
distribution of vegetation types, as well as bare rocks and soils, inland water bodies and human impacted
surfaces.

This indicator estimates the area of land in km2 that has been classified according to the spectral
signature of its physical cover, through the use of remote sensing technology. Because the land cover can
change quickly over time, it is used as an important indicator of change to describe the dynamics of the
Earth surface resulting from a variety of drivers and factors. This indicator serves two functions: (1)
changes in land cover may point to land degradation when there is a loss of ecosystem services that are
considered desirable in a local or national context; and (2) a land cover classification system can be used
to disaggregate the other two indicators for strategic objective 1 (SO1-2 and SO1-3).

The 2018 reporting will present land cover data for the current monitoring period in terms of extent and
percentage of total national land cover for the represented land cover classes. Land cover flows,
representing the losses and gains resulting from changes from one land cover class to a different land
cover class, will also be examined.
