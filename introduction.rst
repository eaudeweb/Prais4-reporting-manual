Reporting manual for the 2019-2020 UNCCD reporting process
****

Background
==========

By decision 7/COP.13, the UNCCD Conference of the Parties (COP) adopted the 2018-2030 strategic
framework, containing five strategic objectives and an implementation framework. The strategic
objectives address:
#. 1. Improvement of the condition of affected ecosystems, combat desertification/land degradation,
promotion of sustainable land management and contribution to land degradation neutrality;
#. 2. Improvement of the living conditions of affected populations;
#. 3. Mitigating, adapting to, and managing the effects of drought in order to enhance resilience of
vulnerable populations and ecosystems;
#. 4. Generating global environmental benefits through effective implementation of the UNCCD; and
#. 5. Mobilization of substantial and additional financial and non-financial resources to support the
implementation of the Convention by building effective partnerships at global and national level

The implementation framework defines the roles and responsibilities of Parties and Convention
institutions in meeting the strategic objectives. For Parties, the implementation framework sets
specific aims under three broad headings: a) Financial and non-financial resources; (b) Policy and
planning; and (c) Actions on the ground.

From 2018 on, UNCCD national reporting will monitor progress made in the implementation of the
2018-2030 strategic framework. The reporting process and tools and the role and responsibilities of
the CRIC in reviewing the reports are spelled out in decisions 13/COP.13 and 15/COP.13.

Purpose
==========

Up-to-date information on measures taken, results achieved and information on challenges faced is
critically important for ensuring that the COP has the necessary knowledge to adopt targeted
decisions and guidance that is focused to support an effective achievement of the strategic
objectives. Such knowledge is valuable also for Parties and other stakeholders that work on the
implementation of the UNCCD at national and local levels. From these viewpoints, national reporting
is an indispensable tool to bring forward effective planning and implementation of the Convention and
the achievement of the strategic objectives at global and national level.

From 2018 on, the UNCCD reporting process will also contribute to the follow-up of progress in
implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The UNCCD secretariat, as the custodian
agency for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1, is requested to use relevant
information submitted in the national reports as a contribution to the overall follow-up and review by the
High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development (HLPF).
