# 4. Strategic objective 4: To generate global environmental benefits through effective implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification

## 4.1. SO 4-1 – Trends in carbon stocks above and below ground

Trends in carbon stocks above and below ground is a multipurpose indicator used to measure progress towards strategic objectives (SOs) 1 and 4. Quantitative data and a qualitative assessment of trends in this indicator are reported under SO 1 (progress indicator SO 1-3).

## 4.2. SO 4-2 – Trends in abundance and distribution of selected species

### 4.2.1. 	Introduction

The world’s species are impacted by several threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. On-ground land restoration actions under the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) can mitigate threatening processes and reduce species extinction risk. The Red List Index (RLI) can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species because of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated. The RLI is also Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.5.1[^1].  The RLI estimates trends in the overall extinction risk of sets of species to determine trends in biodiversity status. It is based on changes in the number of species in each category of extinction risk on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species[^2]. 

The RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as ‘Least Concern’) to 0 (all species are categorized as ‘Extinct’), and so indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the RLI allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e. how threatened they are on average) and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the RLI over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is declining (i.e. the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. Currently, the RLI is available for five taxonomic groups: birds, mammals, amphibians, cycads and warm-water reef-forming corals. It has also been aggregated into a single index for these five groups[^3]. 

The main output of the reporting process for SO 4-2 is a set of officially verified annual estimates of RLI values for 2000–2020. National reporting is facilitated through the provision of default data pre-filled from the SDG database for indicator 15.5.1.

### 4.2.2. 	Prerequisites for reporting

- An in-depth reading of SDG indicator 15.5.1 metadata document;

- Consultation with national experts on biodiversity, species extinction risk, and land management and conservation; Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) national focal points; national statistical offices and IUCN State Members;

- Familiarity with the ‘Advanced Search’ function on the IUCN Red List website to enable customized calculation of the RLI: https://www.iucnredlist.org/search.

### 4.2.3. 	Reporting process and step-by-step procedures

The step-by-step procedure for reporting is described in the following.

_Step 1: Report Red List Index data_

**Table**

The RLI is SDG indicator 15.5.1. Therefore, the RLI data are pre-filled from the SDG database, including the national-level index value as well as the upper and lower bounds of uncertainty around the national estimate. No further action is required if Parties choose to use the default data. 

Parties may decide to customize/complement the values to be reported in table SO4-2.T1. Customised RLI values can be produced from the Red List website[^4].  The RLI can be disaggregated to produce RLIs for different subsets of species with different policy relevance (e.g. migratory species, etc.) or for all species showing trends driven by different threatening processes (e.g. invasive alien species, biological resource use, etc.). At present, disaggregated RLI data is only available at subregional, regional or global scales and it is not available for single countries.

Parties may want to report on regional-scale subsets of species that are more relevant to the implementation of the UNCCD. National experts on biodiversity, species extinction risk, and land management and land conservation actions implemented to mitigate extinction risk should be involved here to decide what disaggregation to use to complete the report. 

Details on the customization of the RLI values should be reported in the ‘General Comments’ section provided in the PRAIS 4 platform.

_Step 2: Qualitatively assess the Red List Index data_

**Table**

Countries are encouraged to identify and then rank which drivers directly or indirectly cause negative changes or downward trends. Countries are also encouraged to comment on the policy responses or levers that have caused positive changes, upward trends or reversal of negative trends in the RLI[^5]. 

[^5]: The direct and indirect drivers available for selection in the table and the levers which can reverse negative trends are summarized from the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity (IPBES) (2019): Global assessment report on biodiversity and ecosystem services of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. E. S. Brondizio, J. Settele, S. Díaz, and H. T. Ngo (editors). IPBES secretariat, Bonn, Germany. 1148 pages. Available at: https://ipbes.net/global-assessment.

_Step 3:  Verify the results_ 

The reliability of the default RLI data needs to be verified by national experts to detect and highlight situations where the confidence level of the obtained results might be low. This would qualitatively assess the reliability of the estimates based on expert knowledge and on a correct interpretation of the data. 
 
_Step 4: Generate reports_

Once verified by the Parties, the estimates of the RLI indicator as well as the qualitative assessment should be officially submitted to UNCCD.    

Parties have the option to use the ‘General Comment’ field to add any relevant information, or to report on specific country or regional situations. 

### 4.2.4. Dependencies 

The SO 4-2 indicator has no interdependencies with other SOs. 

### 4.2.5. Challenges

_Data interpretation_

- The main challenge is the interpretation of changes in the indicator and specifically understanding the drivers of trends in the indicator. The RLI is an aggregate indicator across a small number of taxa and therefore does not include all species in a country. National experts on biodiversity, species extinction risk, and land management and land conservation actions implemented to mitigate extinction risk will be crucial for correct interpretation.

- There are also several sources of uncertainty in the RLI values and trends pertaining to lack of knowledge about species extinction risk, poor data on species, and delays in learning about changes to species extinction risk. The RLI metadata for SDG indicator 15.5.1 should be consulted for more information.

### 4.2.6. Summary

Key actions for reporting on RLI are as follows: 

1.	**Report RLI data**: Parties can use the default data or can choose to report using customized RLI values. 

2.	**Qualitatively assess the RLI data**: Parties can report on the direct and indirect drivers of trends in the RLI and any levers used to bring about positive and transformative change.

3.	**Verify the results**: Aware of the limitations of the RLI values, Parties may verify the accuracy and reliability of such indicators in their countries before officially submitting estimates for UNCCD reporting. 

4.	**Generate reports**: Once verified by the Parties, the data and supporting narrative should be officially submitted to UNCCD.
