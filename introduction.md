# Introduction

## Background
By its decision 7/COP.13, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) adopted the UNCCD 2018–2030 Strategic Framework, containing five strategic objectives (SOs) and an implementation framework. The SOs are:  

- SO 1: To improve the condition of affected ecosystems, combat desertification/land degradation, promote sustainable land management and contribute to land degradation neutrality;

- SO 2: To improve the living conditions of affected populations;  

- SO 3: To mitigate, adapt to, and manage the effects of drought in order to enhance resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems;  

- SO 4: To generate global environmental benefits through effective implementation of the UNCCD; and  

- SO 5: To mobilize substantial and additional financial and non-financial resources to support the implementation of the Convention by building effective partnerships at global and national level.  

The implementation framework defines the roles and responsibilities of Parties and Convention institutions in meeting the SOs. For Parties, the implementation framework sets specific aims under three broad headings: (a) financial and non-financial resources; (b) policy and planning; and (c) actions on the ground.  

Progress made in the implementation of the UNCCD 2018–2030 Strategic Framework has been regularly reviewed through the national reporting process since 2018. The reporting procedures, as well as the role and responsibilities of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC) in reviewing the reports, are spelled out in decisions 13/COP.13 and 15/COP.13.  

## Purpose of national reporting
Up-to-date information on measures taken, results achieved and challenges faced by country Parties is of critical importance for the COP to be able to adopt targeted decisions and guidance aimed at supporting the effective achievement of the SOs. The information communicated by Parties through reporting is valuable also for other stakeholders that work on the implementation of the UNCCD at national and local levels. From these viewpoints, national reporting is an indispensable tool to bringing forward effective planning and implementation of the Convention and the achievement of the SOs at global and national level.  

Since 2018, the UNCCD reporting process has also contributed to the follow-up of progress in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. As the custodian agency for Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1 “Proportion of land that is degraded over total land area”, the UNCCD secretariat is requested to use relevant information submitted in the national reports as a contribution to the overall follow-up and review by the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development. 

## Indicator and monitoring framework
The UNCCD indicator and monitoring framework has a hierarchical structure that makes it possible to distinguish what to measure (progress indicators) and how it should be measured (metrics/proxies).  

Indicators used for reporting on progress towards the SOs are those adopted by Parties in decision 7/COP.13, 9/COP.13 and 11/COP.14. In addition to the indicators adopted by the COP, five newly proposed indicators (i.e. SO 2-3, SO 4-3, SO 5-3, SO 5-4 and SO 5-5) will be tested during the 2022 reporting process. All newly proposed indicators will be considered optional in reporting until the COP takes a decision on whether to formally adopt them. Integrating them in the forthcoming reporting process will enable Parties to assess the suitability of the indicators for measuring progress towards the SOs and take an informed decision at the twentieth session of the CRIC held in conjunction with the COP. Table 1 through table 5 below contain an overview of the indicators, their related metrics/proxies and their statuses (i.e. whether the indicator is officially adopted, and if so, when it was adopted; or whether it is newly proposed and will be tested in the forthcoming reporting process). The tables also provide information on the reporting attributions. 

Reporting on the implementation framework will be done through qualitative information, largely by narratives on national experiences, and on a voluntary basis.
