# Introduction

## Background
By its decision 7/COP.13, the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) adopted the UNCCD 2018–2030 Strategic Framework, containing five strategic objectives (SOs) and an implementation framework. The SOs are:  

SO 1: To improve the condition of affected ecosystems, combat desertification/land degradation, promote sustainable land management and contribute to land degradation neutrality;  
SO 2: To improve the living conditions of affected populations;  

SO 3: To mitigate, adapt to, and manage the effects of drought in order to enhance resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems;  

SO 4: To generate global environmental benefits through effective implementation of the UNCCD; and  

SO 5: To mobilize substantial and additional financial and non-financial resources to support the implementation of the Convention by building effective partnerships at global and national level.  

The implementation framework defines the roles and responsibilities of Parties and Convention institutions in meeting the SOs. For Parties, the implementation framework sets specific aims under three broad headings: (a) financial and non-financial resources; (b) policy and planning; and (c) actions on the ground.  

Progress made in the implementation of the UNCCD 2018–2030 Strategic Framework has been regularly reviewed through the national reporting process since 2018. The reporting procedures, as well as the role and responsibilities of the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC) in reviewing the reports, are spelled out in decisions 13/COP.13 and 15/COP.13.
