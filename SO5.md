# 5. Strategic objective 5: To mobilize substantial and additional financial and non-financial resources to support the implementation of the Convention by building effective partnerships at global and national level

### Introduction

The strategic objective (SO) 5 indicator framework aims to enable Parties to report quantitative and qualitative information on financial and non-financial resources dedicated to supporting the implementation of the Convention. The set of indicators aims at comprehensive reporting. 

This section of the manual addresses the issues related to the identification of resources specific to desertification/land degradation and drought (DLDD) and the structure of the indicator framework. It also explains the Tier approach used. 

Identification of resources specific to DLDD or tracking resources for the implementation of the Convention concerns accounting for (i) the financial and non-financial resources employed by activities that avoid, reduce, and reverse the effects of land degradation and desertification; and (ii) the preparedness for, mitigation of and response to drought at different scales. The most relevant challenge lies in the identification of DLDD-specific resources among a range of those allocated for other purposes.

This section of the user manual does not provide a prescriptive definition of which activities can be accounted for as being DLDD-relevant, nor does it exclude any; however, it includes activities, examples, and options as well as a non-exhaustive list of DLDD activities, which might be useful references for the identification of relevant activities. It is up to the reporting Party to provide insights on how those activities are chosen as relevant and explain the methodology used. 

### Structure and aim of the SO 5 indicator framework

The indicator framework considers the current reporting experiences under the other Rio conventions. It has been revised taking into account the measurement, reporting and verification system under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (with its current Biennial Update Reports), the National Communications templates, and the most recent updates regarding the enhanced transparency framework under the Paris Agreement and the financial reporting framework under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), with the aim of increasing synergies in data collection and reporting.

### Tier approach for SO 5

The SO 5 indicator framework offers flexibility by introducing Tiers, facilitating the reporting for those Parties that lack quantitative and/or detailed data. 

Tier 1 reporting includes descriptive and qualitative information relevant to the indicator, as well as information on trends. Descriptions can include quantitative information at a level of detail which is too low to be reported in the Tier 2 tabular format. It should also include all information that cannot be reported in tabular format, such as descriptions of projects, programmes, instruments, and policies, as well as case studies, experiences, and best practices. 

Tier 2 reporting is additional to Tier 1 reporting and provides a tabular format to be filled in along 16 parameters included in the columns. Tier 2 aims to collect more detailed quantitative and descriptive information at the highest disaggregation level available. The table should be complemented by information on definitions and methodologies used for the relevant parameters to be included in the documentation box. Relevant resources and databases should be included in each indicator, providing references for data sources, definitions, and methodologies in support of the reporting. 


## 5.1. SO 5-1 – Bilateral and multilateral public resources

### 5.1.1. Introduction

This indicator aims to capture information on international resources provided and received through bilateral and multilateral channels. The indicator envisages reporting of information on the trends over the four -year period (Tier 1) and additional quantitative data at disaggregated level in tabular format (Tier 2). Default data will be provided based on the desertification Rio Marker of the OECD, when available[^1].

[^1]: For methodological information see Methodological Note. 

### 5.1.2. Prerequisites for reporting

Institutional arrangements to collect data on international financial and non-financial resources provided and received through bilateral and multilateral channels for the implementation of the Convention. Data on international support provided to and received by third countries are often collected by a country’s ministry of foreign affairs, development agencies or national statistical offices. Countries reporting according to the OECD DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS) count on a relevant source of data. If information on the relevance of resources provided and received specific for DLDD is not available, the country is encouraged to set up relevant institutional arrangements to start collecting this information.

### 5.1.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

If the default data is used, Parties are encouraged to verify the information and amend as necessary, or complement the default data with additional information. Further rows can be added.

The reporting steps are described in the following sections.

#### Step 1: Identification of relevant data

If your country is both a provider and a recipient of international public bilateral and/or multilateral resources, you are encouraged to provide information on both.

**Flows** 

To report against the SO 5-1 indicator, Parties should look at official public flows from international sources. This category tracks primarily resource flows between countries in the form of ‘official development assistance’ (ODA) and ‘other official flows’ (OOF). Both providers and recipients of international public support draw upon the OECD DAC system as a dataset that can be consulted from both the provider and recipient perspectives.

Official transactions are those undertaken by central, state, or local government agencies at their own risk and responsibility. In case an activity or project is funded by different sources of funding – for example, through both public and private resources – it is recommended to report the amount of public resources under the SO 5-1 indicator and the amount of private resources under the SO 5-3 indicator. This would lead to double reporting (the Party would replicate some information related to the relevant project in two separate tables) but would avoid the double-counting of amounts. 



Relevance to desertification/land degradation and drought
The OECD DAC CRS collects activity-level data on activities targeting the environmental objectives of the three Rio conventions (CBD, UNCCD and UNFCCC) through Rio Markers for biodiversity, climate change adaptation, climate change mitigation and desertification. This category can be measured using the Rio Marker for Desertification marker to report on ODA and, where available, on OOF. The OECD Total Official Support for Sustainable Development (TOSSD) dataset include information on support provided by developing countries. Relevant activities can be identified through SDG field (SDG 15.3).
The methodology used to identify DLDD-relevant activities and the classification method used should be clearly explained in the narrative parts of the indicator’s framework and/or in the documentation boxes. 
Step 2: Estimate trends in bilateral and multilateral public resources
Tier 1 involves reporting trends in the progress indicator in qualitative terms (increasing, stable or declining trends) based on the expert opinion of the reporting Party. Choose the option representing the trend in the international public resources provided and received during the four-year period for activities relevant to the implementation of the Convention in the relevant table. Indicate the general trend within that period, for both tables if your country is both a provider and a recipient. Otherwise, indicate the trend for either one. Select only one option for each table. 




Step 3:  Reporting in narrative format
SO5-1 requests descriptive and qualitative information relevant to the international public resources provided and received through bilateral and multilateral channels. The descriptive section may include all information that cannot be reported in tabular format and provide general information on resources provided and received for the implementation of the Convention. 
Step 4:  Compiling the table
Tier 2 involves reporting trends in the progress indicators in a quantitative manner. Under this Tier, country Parties are encouraged to report by recording data about individual projects specific to DLDD. Please compile the table with data at the highest level of disaggregation available. Parties are encouraged to provide activity-level data.
Default data are derived from information reported to the OECD DAC by OECD members based on the desertification Rio Marker;  default data can be amended by the reporting Party as appropriate.
Tier 2 reporting includes: 
•	Detailed information at projects programmes and/or countries/regions, including amounts.
•	Aggregate amounts of resources provided and/or received, by year and/or over the four-year period. 
Parameters
The table for SO 5-1 provides space to report activities or projects relevant to combating DLDD. While the methodological approach to be chosen by the reporting Party accommodates definitions and methodologies in use, the reporting manual suggests some approaches and definitions for each parameter.
•	Provided/received: Indicate ‘provided’ if, for the reported activity, the reporting country is the provider of the resources; indicate ‘received’ if your country is the recipient of the resources.
•	Year: Indicate the year relevant to the reported activity. Explain in the documentation box whether the year refers to the commitment or disbursement year, and if the fiscal or calendar year is used. 
•	Recipient/provider: Indicate the name of the recipient if the reporting country is the provider of resources; indicate the name of the provider if your country is the recipient of resources. This could include the name of the country or the region; be listed as ‘global’ (bilateral flows); or include the name of the institution and/or entity (multilateral flows).
•	Title of project, programme, activity or other: In cases of contributions to multilateral development banks/multilateral funds or participation in replenishments of funds, etc.
•	Total amount in USD: The amounts should be reported in USD; if the reporting country decides otherwise, the approach should be explained clearly in the methodology. This implies the application of an exchange rate to the different domestic currencies. The OECD DAC CRS includes amounts in thousands of USD. The World Bank annual average exchange rate is suggested; please indicate if (and how) a different exchange rate is used. It is possible to report both amounts committed and disbursed for each activity. Committed and disbursed figures cannot be summed up; all reporting shall avoid double-counting across years. From the recipient perspective, the column “committed” can remain empty.
•	Sector: Four macro sectors are suggested in the table. Crosscutting refers to activities that are addressed to more than one sector. The reporting country has the possibility to indicate other sectors, accommodating possible different reporting standards and practices. The indication of ‘other’ is optional; only the name of the sector is to be included.
•	Capacity-building: For each activity and to the extent possible, please indicate whether it includes a capacity-building component; if the activity aims, among other things, to build the capacities of the recipient country; and/or if at least part of the budget of the project has been dedicated to capacity-building to address DLDD.
•	Technology transfer: For each activity and to the extent possible, please indicate whether it includes a technology transfer component; if the activity aims to transfer and develop technologies in the recipient country; and/or if at least part of the budget has been dedicated to transferring technologies to address DLDD. 
•	Gender equality: For each activity and to the extent possible, indicate whether it targets gender equality. The OECD DAC CRS system includes a gender equality policy marker, which could be a useful indicator to compile this column, as available. 
•	Channel: Please indicate whether the amounts to be considered are bilateral (country to country), multi-bilateral (a multilateral entity managing a project on behalf of a country providing earmarked funds for that activity), or multilateral. Type of flow: Indicate whether the flow is ODA or OOF. Other categories should be included if a different classification method is employed.
•	Financial instrument: Please indicate the financial instrument channelling the public resources reported. 
•	Type of support: Indicate whether the activity is directly or indirectly related to the objectives of the Convention. Reporting this information could be based on the use of principal and significant Rio Markers as in the OECD DAC CRS system, where available. 
•	Amount mobilized through public interventions: Indicator SO 5-1 provides the space to include information on amounts mobilized from the private sector by official development finance interventions. In this regard, the OECD DAC offers an instrument-specific approach covering all private finance leveraged by public interventions with a direct causality link between flows. A dedicated column in the proposed tabular format is added to facilitate harmonization with the OECD DAC CRS reporting.
•	Use, impact, (estimated) results: The table provides the space to include additional project-level information about the use of resources, the impact with respect to the objectives of the Convention, and results (estimated if the project did not conclude before the end of the reporting period).
•	Additional information: please include any other activity-level information that you deem relevant.
