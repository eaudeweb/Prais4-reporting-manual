"The WorldPop sex-disaggregated national datasets are presented as several"
" individual rasters, each representing an age/sex class per year. This "
"amounts to a large volume of spatial data in Geotiff format. Capacity in "
"raster data processing and access to appropriate computing power, e.g., a"
" cloud service, is required to store and process the data, especially for"
" large countries. The UNCCD is developing a procedure for the bulk "
"preprocessing of raster data, which will eventually make sex-"
"disaggregated data available on the PRAIS 4 platform as default data. "
"Parties will be notified when the challenge is solved and the forms pre-"
"filled with the default data."

" of population exposure to land degradation over time may not only be due"
