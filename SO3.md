# 3. Strategic objective 3: To mitigate, adapt to, and manage the effects of drought in order to enhance resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems

## 3.1. SO 3-1 – Trends in the proportion of land under drought over the total land area 

### 3.1.1. Introduction

Drought is defined as a period of dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance (World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 1992). The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines drought as the naturally occurring phenomenon that exists when precipitation has been significantly below normal recorded levels, causing serious hydrological imbalances that adversely affect land resource production systems.  

Indicator SO 3-1 specifically describes the status of meteorological drought hazards that occurred during the baseline and reporting periods within a country.

There are several drought indices that might be used to estimate national drought hazard. The UNCCD methodology to estimate indicator SO 3-1 recommends using a globally accepted drought index, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), to characterize the meteorological drought hazard. However, Parties may report using other indices if already in use at national level. For example, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) may represent an alternative index, readily comparable to the SPI, that provides more reliable signals of drought in arid areas. Parties using the SPEI can apply the same methods recommended in this manual and in the “Good Practice Guidance for National Reporting on UNCCD Strategic Objective 3” to report indicator SO 3-1. For other indices currently in use, Parties may need to ensure statistical consistency with the SPI drought intensity classes described in table 19. 

The overall objective is for Parties to assess drought hazard and identify areas exposed to extreme drought in order to prioritize mitigation efforts in conjunction with assessments of drought exposure (SO 3-2) and vulnerability (SO 3-3). National reporting is facilitated though the provision of default data.
