# 3. Strategic objective 3: To mitigate, adapt to, and manage the effects of drought in order to enhance resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems

## 3.1. SO 3-1 – Trends in the proportion of land under drought over the total land area 

### 3.1.1. Introduction

Drought is defined as a period of dry weather long enough to cause a serious hydrological imbalance (World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 1992). The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) defines drought as the naturally occurring phenomenon that exists when precipitation has been significantly below normal recorded levels, causing serious hydrological imbalances that adversely affect land resource production systems[^1].

There are several drought indices that might be used to estimate national drought hazard. The UNCCD methodology to estimate indicator SO 3-1 recommends using a globally accepted drought index, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), to characterize the meteorological drought hazard. However, Parties may report using other indices if already in use at national level. For example, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) may represent an alternative index, readily comparable to the SPI, that provides more reliable signals of drought in arid areas. Parties using the SPEI can apply the same methods recommended in this manual and in the “Good Practice Guidance for National Reporting on UNCCD Strategic Objective 3” to report indicator SO 3-1. For other indices currently in use, Parties may need to ensure statistical consistency with the SPI drought intensity classes described in table 19[^2]. 

[^2]: "The Global Drought Classification System (GDCS, formerly the Global Drought Indicator or GDI), currently under development by WMO through the Global Multi-Hazard Alert System (GMAS) framework, will provide methods on how a multitude of drought indices can be translated onto a harmonized legend of drought classes.
Indicator SO 3-1 specifically describes the status of meteorological drought hazards that occurred during the baseline and reporting periods within a country."

The overall objective is for Parties to assess drought hazard and identify areas exposed to extreme drought in order to prioritize mitigation efforts in conjunction with assessments of drought exposure (SO 3-2) and vulnerability (SO 3-3). National reporting is facilitated though the provision of default data.

### 3.1.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- An in-depth reading of chapter 1 of the [“Good Practice Guidance for National Reporting on UNCCD Strategic Objective 3: To mitigate, adapt to, and manage the effects of drought in order to enhance resilience of vulnerable populations and ecosystems”](https://www.unccd.int/publications/good-practice-guidance-national-reporting-unccd-strategic-objective-3-mitigate-adapt) detailing the methodology used to estimate drought hazards and the changes over time.

- Data complying with the specifications listed in figure 1 and table 18.

- A pool of national experts officially nominated by the national authorities to verify the consistency of the results of the reporting process with the situation in the field, or to develop and implement a custom methodology to estimate indicator SO 3-1 where national data are preferred to the default data. Key institutions might include a country’s national meteorological and hydrological service (NMHS), ministry of environment, ministry of agriculture, remote sensing centre and national statistical office, as well as relevant universities and research centres.

### 3.1.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The step-by-step procedure for reporting is described in the following. If the default data is used, steps 2 to 5 are unnecessary.

_Step 1: Select precipitation dataset_

The UNCCD provides default data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) Monitoring Product, a gridded precipitation product derived from rain gauge data. Parties have the option to use an alternative default dataset in Trends.Earth: the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS), which produces high-resolution estimates based on satellite observations and gauged station data. While the higher spatial resolution of CHIRPS and slightly longer recording period are advantageous when deriving the SPI, it has a ‘quasi-global’ coverage that spans 50°S to 50°N. Therefore, Parties with country boundaries exceeding this range will not be able to use the CHRIPS dataset. In contrast, the GPCC precipitation data has global coverage. 

Parties wishing to use in-country data provided by the NMHS or regional, rather than global, precipitation products can use the decision tree in figure 1 to assess whether the in-country (or regional) precipitation data is more appropriate to derive indicator SO 3-1 over the globally available datasets.
