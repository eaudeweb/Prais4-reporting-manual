To improve the living conditions of affected populations

## 2.1. SO 2-1 – Trends in population living below the relative poverty line and/or income inequality in affected areas

### 2.1.1. Introduction

Indicator SO 2-1 estimates the well-being of populations in monetary terms. 

Two metrics are used for this purpose and Parties should specify which metrics they would like to use: 

- Proportion of the population below the international poverty line, or

- Income inequality.

These metrics can be used interchangeably according to country-specific conditions.

The proportion of the population below the international poverty line is generally considered relevant to less developed countries, where extreme poverty and destitution are core development challenges. The international poverty line is currently set at USD 1.90 a day, based on 2011 purchasing power parity. Therefore, the proportion of the population below the international poverty line is defined as the percentage of the population living on less than USD 1.90 a day at 2011 international prices.

Income inequality is a useful metric for both low-income and middle-income countries as it estimates the extent of wealth distribution in a region. It is estimated through the Gini index. The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.  

National reporting is facilitated though the provision of default data. As the proportion of population below the international poverty line by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural) is also a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator (SDG indicator 1.1.1), default data is pre-filled from the SDG database. For income inequality (i.e., the Gini index), default data is pre-filled from the [World Bank database](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?end=2015&start=1979&view=map). 

### 2.1.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- An in-depth reading of SDG indicator 1.1.1 metadata and Gini index metadata (see section 2.1.7). 

- Data complying with the specifications listed in table 15.

- A pool of national experts officially nominated by the national authorities to verify the suitability and consistency of the default data against the situation in their country, or to identify and compile data using national sources for the three metrics. Key institutions might include a country’s national statistical office and the ministry of finance, as well as universities and research centres.

### 2.1.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The step-by-step procedure for reporting is described in the following.

_Step 1: Choose the most suitable metric_

Parties are invited to choose the most suitable metric to represent the well-being of the population in their countries.

_Step 2: Identify the relevant dataset_

The proportion of population below the international poverty line data is pre-filled from the SDG database, while income inequality (Gini index) data is pre-filled from the World Bank database. 

Parties may also use national data, provided it complies with the data specifications listed in table 15. 

_Table 15. Data specifications for SO 2-1 Indicator_

<table BORDER=3 BORDERCOLOR=BLACK>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th rowspan=2>Item</th>
      <th colspan=2>Specifications</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Default data<p>((Sustainable Development Goal indicator 1.1.1 data and Gini index World Bank data))</p></th>
      <th>National data</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Type of data</th>
      <td>Annual data on one of the two metrics for the period 2000–2019.</td>
      <td>Annual data on one of the two metrics for the period from 2000 to the latest available year for the reporting period.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Spatial resolution</th>
      <td>Country level</td>
      <td>Country or sub-national levels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Quality</th>
      <td>Specified in the datasets’ metadata.</td>
      <td>TTo be indicated in the dataset metadata.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Metadata</th>
      <td>Metadata information is provided with default data.</td>
      <td>Minimum metadata content as per the mandatory fields listed in Annex II.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>

_Step 3: Report national annual values of the chosen metric and interpret the data_

<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=BLACK>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><I>Related areas in the PRAIS 4 platform: tables SO2-1.T1, SO2-1.T2 and SO2-1.T3</I></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Parties opting to use an alternative source of national data may enter the relevant national annual values in tables SO2-1.T1 or SO2-1.T2, according to the chosen metric.

To assist in the data interpretation, countries are encouraged to visualize their respective metrics by means of a graph (graphs for each country are available on the [World Bank website](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgs/index.html)).  While it may be difficult to attribute specific causal factors to changes in the metrics, countries may indicate which direct and/or indirect drivers are presumably behind the observed changes and report this information in the Qualitative Assessment table (i.e., Table SO2-1.T3).

_Step 4:  Verify the results_

The reliability of the estimates from global data sources requires inputs from national experts to detect and highlight situations where the confidence level of the obtained results might be low. This input would contribute to a qualitative assessment of the reliability of the estimates. 

_Step 5: Generate reports_

Once verified by the Parties, the estimates of the proportion of population below the international poverty line, or income inequality should be officially submitted to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Observed changes and their interpretation may be described in the “Qualitative Assessment” table of the PRAIS 4 platform. 

Optionally, Parties may include additional information in the General Comment field to describe specific country situations. Sub-national disaggregated data (e.g., per administrative division, urban vs rural, affected areas or other socio-economic strata, e.g., sex-disaggregated data) may be useful to identify where the most significant poverty/income inequality hotspots/brightspots are located. 

Parties are also encouraged to submit narratives on the methodology, data sources and data accuracy in the event that the estimates are derived from national data. It would also be beneficial to report on special cases and issues, describing any deviation from the default method and providing the rationale to adopt a different methodology.

### 2.1.4. Dependencies

Indicator SO 2-1 has no dependencies from other SO, however it could be used in the calculation of the Drought Vulnerability Index (DVI) for indicator SO 3-3.

### 2.1.5. Challenges 

_Data availability and quality_
- International global data only generically describes the well-being of the population in a country and might not capture specific situations in need of consideration. More detailed sub-national data might be needed to represent the economic situation at the local level. 

### 2.1.6. Summary (main actions)

Key actions for reporting on indicator SO 2-1 are as follows:

1.	**Choose the most suitable metric**: Parties are encouraged to choose the most suitable metric to represent the well-being of the population in their countries.

2.	**Identify the relevant dataset**: Parties may decide to use the default data or alternative national sources.

3.	**Report national annual values of the chosen metric and interpret the data**: Parties are invited to report, visualize and interpret the national annual data.

4.	**Verify the results**: the reliability of the estimates from global data sources requires inputs from national experts to qualitatively assess the reliability of the estimates based on expert knowledge.

5.	**Generate reports**: once verified by the Parties, the data and supporting narrative should be officially submitted to the UNCCD.
