To improve the living conditions of affected populations

## 2.1. SO 2-1 – Trends in population living below the relative poverty line and/or income inequality in affected areas

### 2.1.1. Introduction

Indicator SO 2-1 estimates the well-being of populations in monetary terms. 

Two metrics are used for this purpose and Parties should specify which metrics they would like to use: 

- Proportion of the population below the international poverty line, or

- Income inequality.

These metrics can be used interchangeably according to country-specific conditions.

The proportion of the population below the international poverty line is generally considered relevant to less developed countries, where extreme poverty and destitution are core development challenges. The international poverty line is currently set at USD 1.90 a day, based on 2011 purchasing power parity. Therefore, the proportion of the population below the international poverty line is defined as the percentage of the population living on less than USD 1.90 a day at 2011 international prices.

Income inequality is a useful metric for both low-income and middle-income countries as it estimates the extent of wealth distribution in a region. It is estimated through the Gini index. The Gini index measures the extent to which the distribution of income (or, in some cases, consumption expenditure) among individuals or households within an economy deviates from perfectly equal distribution. A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality.  

National reporting is facilitated though the provision of default data. As the proportion of population below the international poverty line by sex, age, employment status and geographical location (urban/rural) is also a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator (SDG indicator 1.1.1), default data is pre-filled from the SDG database. For income inequality (i.e., the Gini index), default data is pre-filled from the [World Bank database](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI?end=2015&start=1979&view=map). 

### 2.1.2. Prerequisites for reporting

- An in-depth reading of SDG indicator 1.1.1 metadata and Gini index metadata (see section 2.1.7). 

- Data complying with the specifications listed in table 15.

- A pool of national experts officially nominated by the national authorities to verify the suitability and consistency of the default data against the situation in their country, or to identify and compile data using national sources for the three metrics. Key institutions might include a country’s national statistical office and the ministry of finance, as well as universities and research centres.

### 2.1.3. Reporting process and step-by-step procedure

The step-by-step procedure for reporting is described in the following.

_Step 1: Choose the most suitable metric_

Parties are invited to choose the most suitable metric to represent the well-being of the population in their countries.

_Step 2: Identify the relevant dataset_

The proportion of population below the international poverty line data is pre-filled from the SDG database, while income inequality (Gini index) data is pre-filled from the World Bank database. 

Parties may also use national data, provided it complies with the data specifications listed in table 15.

    </tr>

      <td>Country level</td>
      <td>Country or sub-national levels</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Quality</th>
      <td>Specified in the datasets’ metadata.</td>
      <td>TTo be indicated in the dataset metadata.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Metadata</th>
      <td>Metadata information is provided with default data.</td>
      <td>Minimum metadata content as per the mandatory fields listed in Annex II.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>

_Step 3: Report national annual values of the chosen metric and interpret the data_

<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=BLACK>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><I>Related areas in the PRAIS 4 platform: tables SO2-1.T1, SO2-1.T2 and SO2-1.T3</I></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Parties opting to use an alternative source of national data may enter the relevant national annual values in tables SO2-1.T1 or SO2-1.T2, according to the chosen metric.

To assist in the data interpretation, countries are encouraged to visualize their respective metrics by means of a graph (graphs for each country are available on the [World Bank website](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgs/index.html or https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SI.POV.GINI)).  While it may be difficult to attribute specific causal factors to changes in the metrics, countries may indicate which direct and/or indirect drivers are presumably behind the observed changes and report this information in the Qualitative Assessment table (i.e., Table SO2-1.T3).
